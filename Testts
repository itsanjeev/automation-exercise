Instead of creating a fresh Azure agent VM every time, we propose a snapshot and restore-based model for agent lifecycle management.

ðŸ”§ Core Concept
	1.	Pre-Provision and Snapshot Agents:
	â€¢	Create a small pool (e.g., 4â€“6) of standardized Azure DevOps Windows agents.
	â€¢	Pre-install all dependencies, registry configurations, and environment setups.
	â€¢	Take an OS Disk Snapshot of each agent in its clean, ready-to-run state.
	2.	Pipeline Execution:
	â€¢	When a test pipeline is triggered, it picks an idle agent from the pool.
	â€¢	The test executes directly on this pre-configured agent â€” no provisioning delay.
	3.	Post-Execution Restore (Clean Slate Reset):
	â€¢	After the test completes and artifacts are collected, the agentâ€™s OS disk is restored from its baseline snapshot.
	â€¢	The agent reverts to a pristine state automatically, ready for the next pipeline.

This approach guarantees:
	â€¢	Fresh state for every test run (registry, filesystem, services)
	â€¢	Zero agent re-creation time
	â€¢	Predictable and reproducible test environments
