üîπ Key Observations on Copilot‚Äôs Impact Detection

‚úÖ 1. Automated Impact Detection Works Well, But Has Limitations
VS Code (Copilot Edit) accurately detects impacted classes, step definitions, and feature files.
However, for large projects, Copilot sometimes misses files or updates the wrong references (especially when method names are the same in multiple classes).
‚úÖ 2. Method Name Updates Can Affect Unrelated Classes
If the same method name exists in multiple classes, and if the class names are also similar, Copilot might update the wrong reference.
Workaround: Be very specific with the prompt, including the exact class path to ensure Copilot updates only the intended method.
‚úÖ 3. Feature File Impact Detection is Good, But Not Perfect
Copilot correctly identifies impacted feature files, but it doesn‚Äôt determine the exact Cucumber tags that need to be run.
This requires manual filtering to ensure only the relevant regression tests are executed.
‚úÖ 4. Manual Review is Still Necessary
Larger projects with thousands of files require manual verification, as Copilot may not scan every file efficiently.
Best practice: Use Copilot for initial detection, then manually verify the changes before committing.
üîπ Metric Comparison: Copilot (VS Code) vs. Copilot (IntelliJ) vs. Manual Approach

Metric	GitHub Copilot Edit (VS Code)	GitHub Copilot (IntelliJ IDEA)	Manual Approach	Observations & Recommendations
Accuracy	‚úÖ Detects impacted methods & step definitions well	‚ùå No Copilot Edit; manual search required	‚úÖ 100% accurate when done manually	Copilot is good, but manual validation is still required for large projects.
Coverage	‚ö†Ô∏è Can miss files in large frameworks	‚ùå No automated detection, requires full manual search	‚úÖ Covers all references manually	For large projects, verify all updates manually.
Reliability	‚ö†Ô∏è Can mistakenly update similar method names in other classes	‚ùå No refactoring automation	‚úÖ No risk of updating incorrect references	Use precise prompts with class paths to avoid incorrect updates.
Detection Accuracy	‚úÖ Finds impacted feature files but doesn‚Äôt suggest exact Cucumber tags	‚ùå No automated feature file detection	‚úÖ Manually verifies all cases	Copilot helps, but Cucumber tag selection needs manual refinement.
Execution Time Improvement	‚úÖ Saves time by automatically updating multiple references	‚ùå Slowest (requires full manual refactoring)	‚ùå Most time-consuming but accurate	Copilot is much faster, but manual validation is a must.
üîπ Best Practices for Using GitHub Copilot Effectively

1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Precise Prompts with Exact Paths:
If method names exist in multiple classes, specify the full class path in your prompt.
Example Prompt:
"Find and update the StartNewClaim method to StartNewClaimUpdated in com.automation.pages.MainPage. Ensure all references are updated in stepdefinitions/ only, without modifying other classes with similar method names."
2Ô∏è‚É£ Manually Review All Changes in Large Projects:
For projects with thousands of files, Copilot may not scan all references efficiently.
Use GitHub Copilot Edit first, then manually verify the updates before committing changes.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Check for Incorrect Updates in Similar Classes:
If two classes have the same method name, Copilot might mistakenly update both.
Always review the diff to confirm the right class was updated.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Use Manual Filtering for Cucumber Feature Files & Tags:
While Copilot can find impacted feature files, it won‚Äôt identify the exact test tags to run for regression.
Manually determine which tests need execution after updates.
üîπ Final Verdict: Copilot is Powerful, But Needs Human Oversight

‚úÖ GitHub Copilot Edit in VS Code is excellent for refactoring and impact detection, but it‚Äôs not perfect.
‚úÖ For large frameworks, manual review is essential to catch missed updates and incorrect changes.
‚úÖ Cucumber test tag filtering still requires human intervention.
‚úÖ IntelliJ lacks GitHub Copilot Edit, making refactoring purely manual.
