Here’s a clear and professional **intro PPT structure** for the **MCP Server concept**, formatted as a Gamma-friendly text block. This will generate a polished presentation with minimal editing.

**Title: Introduction to MCP Server Development**

---

**Slide 1: What is an MCP Server?**

* An **MCP Server** is a lightweight backend program that exposes functionality to LLM applications via the **Model Context Protocol**.
* It acts as a bridge between the **client (inside the host)** and **external data, tools, or services**.
* Servers expose capabilities like:

  * **Tools** (actions)
  * **Resources** (read-only data)
  * **Prompt Templates** (predefined prompts)

---

**Slide 2: Why Build an MCP Server?**

* Extend the capabilities of LLM hosts (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor).
* Connect your AI application to:

  * APIs
  * Databases
  * Filesystems
  * Internal tools
* Abstract logic into reusable, callable endpoints for LLMs.
* Encourage modular, scalable, and secure design.

---

**Slide 3: How MCP Servers Work**

* Server follows the **MCP protocol** to communicate with clients.
* Responsibilities of the server:

  * Register tools, resources, and prompt templates.
  * Respond to requests from the client.
  * Maintain state (if needed) via supported transport mechanisms.
* Communication happens over **standard I/O** (local) or **HTTP/SSE** (remote).

---

**Slide 4: Core Components of an MCP Server**

1. **Tools**

   * Executable functions that perform a task.
   * Defined with decorators in Python SDK.
2. **Resources**

   * Static or dynamic data exposed at specific URIs.
   * Templated or fixed.
3. **Prompt Templates**

   * Predefined user-assistant interactions.
   * Help reduce prompt engineering effort.

---

**Slide 5: Server Setup and Transports**

* **Local Servers**:

  * Use **Standard I/O** (subprocess-based).
  * Ideal for testing and development.
* **Remote Servers**:

  * Use **HTTP with SSE** (stateful)
  * Or **Streamable HTTP** (supports stateful & stateless)
* Choice of transport depends on scalability and deployment needs.

---

**Slide 6: Benefits of Using MCP Servers**
✅ Seamlessly connect LLMs to real-world data and actions
✅ Isolate logic into clear components (tool, resource, prompt)
✅ Promote reusability and separation of concerns
✅ Easily integrate with existing systems via Python SDK

---

**Slide 7: What’s Next**

* Learn how to:

  * Install and use the Python MCP SDK
  * Write and register your first tool
  * Expose resources and prompt templates
  * Launch your own MCP server locally
* Hands-on coding starts in the next lesson!
